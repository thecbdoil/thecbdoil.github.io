Each cannabinoid has a different effect on the body, some promote relaxation while others promote wakefulness, and full-spectrum hemp oil contains a natural mix.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid - a chemical compound that acts throughout the body, including on certain parts of the brain, and is becoming increasingly popular in the health world. People suffering from arthritis have severe inflammation in their joints, and they are plagued with pain.

<p>Poor quality CBD or toxins are common for sub-par companies who don't test their products. These two compounds are the main active cannabinoids of the marijuana plant.

In theory, CBD oil should consist of two main ingredients: the compound cannabidiol dissolved in an oil made from hemp seeds or coconut.</p>

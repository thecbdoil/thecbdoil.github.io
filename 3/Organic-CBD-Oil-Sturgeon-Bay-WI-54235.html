<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. While the scientific jury may still be out on some of the benefits of CBD oil, people are still using it and finding relief. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Most CBD oil and treats for dogs comes from hemp oil , so it contains no or very small traces of THC. Although ingesting CBD offers the most benefits, the body can absorb CBD through the skin. With over 9,000 verified customer reviews on our products, we hope that everyday people sharing their personal stories and experiences can help guide and inform you before you purchase CBD oil.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, however, is the fact that Charlotte's Web is now offering 10mL CBD oil samplers and 7-count CBD capsules. A recent study has shown that a 600mg dose of CBD oil has reduced the resting blood pressure of nine healthy men. Because Amazon won't cut it, we did some digging to find a handful of reliable companies and retailers that sell authentic CBD products. Two separate studies have shown that CBD oil has antioxidant and neuroprotective qualities that help in reducing neurological damage caused by free radicals.</p>

<p>But it remains illegal to put the compound in food, and the Food and Drug Administration has warned CBD makers several times, including last month , over violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act Muddying the waters further, three states — South Dakota, Idaho and Mississippi — make no distinction in their laws between marijuana and hemp plants, meaning CBD is considered a controlled substance in those states.

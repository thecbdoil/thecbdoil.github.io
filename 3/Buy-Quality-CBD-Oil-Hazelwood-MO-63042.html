However, studies have concluded that some side effects might be attributed to its interaction with other drugs you might be taking. Studies of CBD oil aren't common. The term "cannabis oil" is sometimes used to describe CBD oil; however, it's more commonly used to describe oil produced from marijuana strains containing significant THC levels. But CBD in its isolate and low-THC forms is not likely to cause anxiety.</p>
<p>One study has found that CBD oil prevented activity in the sebaceous glands that produce sebum leading to clearer, less oily skin. Arkell TR, Lintzeris N, Kevin RC, et al.

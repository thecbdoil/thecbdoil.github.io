<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. The real miracle of plant-based cannabinoids - like CBD - is how precisely they mimic and interact with the bodies own endocannabinoids and receptor system. Cannabis is a family of plants with two primary classifications - Indica and Sativa, however these classifications are under debate. If you want a broad range of cannabinoids and other hemp compounds, go with our broad-spectrum oil. When the essential oils of the hemp plant are first extracted, the resulting product is considered raw hemp extract. Before testing the Bota Hemp CBD oil, we unanimously decided to take a one-week break from all CBD products.</p>

<h2>Are You Curious About The Hoopla Regarding HEMP CBD in Streamwood?</h2>
<p>CBD comes from hemp and cannabis plants. Research and customer anecdotes demonstrate how CBD may benefit a plethora of conditions including anxiety, inflammation, arthritis, joint pain, migraines, pain, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), inflammation and sleep. CBD Oil is a prepared Cannabidiol extract from the Cannabis sativa plant—marijuana for us laypeople—that has demonstrated some remarkable health benefits. Some early research shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily does not improve anxiety during public speaking in people with social anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>Hi Brenda, Medical Cannabis for postherpetic neuralgia has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties that can significantly reduce the pain shingles causes and any long-term effects. Humans and animals have a 12,000-year-old history with hemp, and the first recorded medicinal uses of CBD rich hemp products date back to China some 5,000 years ago when Emperor Shennong first documented the use and discovery of the healing properties of cannabinoids. Many standard treatments for anxiety can have side effects, and these side effects include depression, addiction, and weight loss or gain.</p>

Vaping CBD oil has also been found to be an effective way to aid the quitting of marijuana smoking, reducing the stress, anxiety and insomnia that often come with withdrawal, but without any of the psychoactive or addictive effects experienced when using the cannabis plant as a whole.

<p>Zoe Wilder, a journalist who has written extensively on the medical applications of Cannabis, says, What's different is how they are treated and handled.” Whereas CBD cannabis oil comes from the Cannabis Indica species of cannabis plant, CBD hemp oil comes from industrial hemp, also known as the Cannabis Sativa species. According to the researchstudy, GPR55 has actually also been found in a variety of fatal healthconditions.

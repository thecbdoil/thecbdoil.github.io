<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Marijuana products, on the other hand, are only legal in about 11 states at the moment over the counter, and over a dozen other states through medical-only programs. This trend is encouraging several CBD oil companies to focus on the internet-savvy customer segment and explore the new online retailing format based on websites and portals.

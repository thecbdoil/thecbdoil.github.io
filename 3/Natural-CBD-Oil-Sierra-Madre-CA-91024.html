<p>They must keep in mind that the FDA do not approve or regulate nonprescription CBD products. Because of the vast diversity of chemicals found in Cannabis(THC, CBD, CBN, CBG, etc) isolating a specific chemical can paint an inaccurate picture of the medical efficacy of plant.

Some CBD products may contain unwanted surprises. Another indirect way that CBD oil may boost your athletic performance and confer some fitness benefits is by managing anxiety and stress. Finally, keep in mind that the term cannabis oil” is very general and that you should ask for further clarification if you are looking to buy CBD oil.</p>
<p>The first - and more well-known compound - THC is responsible for that ‘high' feeling in addition to some inflammation and pain relief properties.

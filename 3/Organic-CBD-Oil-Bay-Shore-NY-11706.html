While CBD oil is made from the leaves or buds of a cannabis plant, hempseed oil is made by pressing oil from hempseed,” says Kyle, who likened it to how olive oil is made by pressing whole olives. Both hemp and marijuana have dozens of other beneficial phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol. Because the FDA doesn't regulate CBD, it is possible to buy a product that is more or less potent than advertised, or even contains small amounts of THC. Hemp seeds make an effective way to grow hemp crops that will eventually produce CBD, but you have to really know how to plant the seeds.</p>

<p>With the rising popularity of CBD oil for dogs, there's a plethora of companies selling cannabis products. Take note, however, that some CBD oils may contain trace amounts of THC. Phrases such as Hemp-derived, Full spectrum, Pure cannabidiol, and Certified CBD must be mentioned in the label. CBD oil comes from the buds, flowers, and leaves of the plant.

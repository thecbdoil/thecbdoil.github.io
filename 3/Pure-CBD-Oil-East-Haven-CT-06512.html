<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits. Additionally, several animal studies have demonstrated that CBD may help reduce the inflammation and cell death associated with heart disease due to its powerful antioxidant and stress-reducing properties. For a CBD product to be considered as a legal hemp product, it needs to have no more than 0.3% THC.</p>
<p>Canopy Growth Corporation is one of the leading medical marijuana companies that manufactures and sells CBD oil products through its well-known subsidiary Bedrocan. The term Marijuana is mostly used these days in place of Cannabis (and not hemp) as it is associated these days with recreational Cannabis (Cannabis high in THC). CBD is a cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. Products that contain CBD isolate should only contain CBD. As you know CBD is a new treatment option so there are almost no scientific studies and very few case studies available.</p>

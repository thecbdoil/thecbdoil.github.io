Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine. While there's a lot of tongue-wagging around cannabis-related products, there is a burgeoning awareness about the potential medical benefits of CBD oil.</p>

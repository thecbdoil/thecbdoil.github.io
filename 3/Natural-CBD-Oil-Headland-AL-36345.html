<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. CBD doesn't contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana that produces a high. CBD also works as an anti-inflammatory which can reduce pain associated with swollen areas. Two species of cannabis are the marijuana plant and the hemp plant. The CBD hemp oil benefits are the most intense because it has the highest levels of cannabinoids. The company is dedicated to using only material that it grows and extracts itself, so they control every step of the manufacturing process to ensure product quality.</p>

Whenever something is wrong with your health, your body naturally produces cannabinoids to bring it into homeostasis.

CBD is a compound that interacts with your endocannabinoid system and other vital systems in your body to help manage stress and alter pain perception. CBD research is ongoing, and while larger clinical trials are necessary to confirm, plenty of studies show promise in using CBD oil to treat a variety of health issues.

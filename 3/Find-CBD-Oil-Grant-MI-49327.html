<p>However, before visiting the clinic you must register online so we are able to discuss your condition and if Medical Cannabis is right for you. The first difference you'll notice in hemp oil vs. CBD oil is the part of the cannabis sativa plant that these oils come from. Both in body and mind, the cannabinoids in CBD massage oil helps to do this.

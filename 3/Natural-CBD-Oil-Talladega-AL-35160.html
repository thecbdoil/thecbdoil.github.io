<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Another huge benefit that comes with using CBD as a pain reliever is that it has no meaningful interactions with opioids, meaning it won't impact the effects of regular painkillers and can be taken alongside them. As with other wellness products, there is no one-size-fits-all serving amount for CBD. CBD is one of 104 chemical compounds, known as cannabinoids, that can be found in the cannabis plant.

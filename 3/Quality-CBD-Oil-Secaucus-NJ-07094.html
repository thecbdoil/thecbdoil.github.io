<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. Vaping CBD oil supposedly helps the body absorb higher amounts of CBD at a faster rate. One of the great things about Ananda Hemp is that they have seed to product control, which means they work with plant geneticists and farmers to create first-rate hemp plants. Broad spectrum oil — An oil rich in CBD and the beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes present in hemp EXCEPT for THC. Its CBD products are sourced exclusively from non-GMO, organically grown, sustainable hemp to phytonutrient-rich hemp oils and terpenes.</p>
<p>Although there is not much hereditary difference between cannabis and hemp, the plants' flowers and leaves contain different amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid responsible for getting high.” Though research has shown some traces of THC in certain CBD oils, most do not contain any THC. But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>

<p>Since CBD is a non-psychoactive compound of the cannabis plant, it's thought to be a safer and healthier alternative to opioid-based painkillers, which are notoriously addictive and often accompanied by severe side effects. The hemp CBD oil is then filtered out for human use. With general information being broadcast about the benefits of extracting cannabidiol from the hemp plant, that is related to but devoid of hallucinatory properties of marijuana, the extensive benefits can be easily accessed by most people.</p>
<p>As CBD oil is used by people with insomnia, it should come as no surprise that CBD can cause drowsiness in some patients. Because we are looking at Full spectrum products, it isn't always better to have as much CBD as possible, but to have as many other cannabinoids as possible (this is also a subject of the problem” or disease that we want to treat, as different cannabinoids have different benefits). CBD-Only products will not test positive for THC on a drug screen. Research published in 2014 found that CBD oil had anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects in an animal model.</p>

<p>None of our products are designed or intended to treat, cure, or help diagnose any medical condition, ailment, or disease. Cannabidiol is a compound derived from cannabis plants. CBD hemp oil, on the other hand, can actually counter the symptoms associated with negative psychological reaction to THC, including memory loss and chronic paranoia. Whereas access to medical marijuana is dependent on state laws — and in some states, might not be legal at all — CBD hemp oil is easy to obtain online.

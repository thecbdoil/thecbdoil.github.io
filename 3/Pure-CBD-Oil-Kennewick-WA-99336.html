The real miracle of plant-based cannabinoids - like CBD - is how precisely they mimic and interact with the bodies own endocannabinoids and receptor system. Cannabis is a family of plants with two primary classifications - Indica and Sativa, however these classifications are under debate. If you want a broad range of cannabinoids and other hemp compounds, go with our broad-spectrum oil.

<p>The plant Cannabis sativa has two primary species, hemp and marijuana. Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, impacts the brain without a high, and tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC, has pain-relieving properties. The plant is cold processed in high quality extra virgin hemp seed oil. Overall, CBD oil is extracted from the flowers of the hemp plant, instead of the leaves or seeds. One study found that a single dose of cannabidiol helped to reduce blood pressure in healthy patients. On the other hand, CBD oil is made with extracts from the flowers, leaves, and stalks of cannabis Sativa, which are rich in CBD and other cannabinoids.</p>

CBD Edibles: ingestible products that use CBD oil as an ingredient in addition to other ingredients. The main finding from this case study is that CBD can be an effective compound to reduce anxiety and insomnia secondary to PTSD.

<p>By using these poor quality products (usually sold in high street stores), you're missing out on the true CBD benefits.

Marijuana and CBD are currently fully legal for both medicinal and recreational purposes in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Washington D.C. In 23 states, it's legal in some form, such as for medicinal purposes.</p>

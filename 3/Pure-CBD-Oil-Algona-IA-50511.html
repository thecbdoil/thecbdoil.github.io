<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN).

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>
<p>These states have more complex laws pertaining to hemp- and marijuana-based CBD oils. The one day I had some serious back pain, My brother's neighbour suggested that I should try CBD oil for my pain as it helps his mom with her cancer pain, and directed me to SABotanicals, a local CBD store in San Antonio where I bought a 2000mg CBD oil. You may have to try different forms or dosages to gauge the full effects of CBD to your body.

Since CBD provides robust pain relief options, it is possible to use it as a treatment strategy. In a study (4) , published in the International Journal of Neuroscience in 2009, such patients when treated with oral doses of 100-600mg CBD oil per day for a period of 6 weeks, alongside standard medications, showed signs of improvement.</p>
<p>In addition to these incredible health benefits, emerging evidence suggests that CBD provides even more benefits when combined with natural terpenoids and other phytocannabinoids found in the hemp plant. However, the overall risks associated with CBD are considered to be mild, and most users do not experience any significant adverse effects. Additionally, studies have found that CBD and other cannabinoids are helpful in managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting , and may also help to improve appetite.</p>

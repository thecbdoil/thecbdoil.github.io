<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. More research is needed to determine the exact role that terpenes play in the overall effects of CBD oil, but it seems clear that terpenes work in concert with cannabinoids to produce a richer effect than CBD alone. First, testing by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has found evidence of ‘potential adverse health effects' from CBD (more on that later) and the FSA has concerns over CBD products being sold that contain unlisted and possibly even hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of psychoactive THC.</p>
<p>CBD hemp oil has a huge range of potential health benefits and uses, including reducing pain, soothing anxiety, fighting chronic diseases, improving mood, eliminating depression , preventing inflammatory arthritis, protecting the immune system, balancing the metabolism , aiding sleep disorders, and healing the skin , among others. Cannabinoids are naturally produced by the human body and found in certain plants such as hemp. CBD is another cannabinoid also known as Cannabidiol which constitutes up to 40% of the plant's overall contents.</p>

This compound is known for its psychoactive effects when consumed with cannabis, or marijuana.</p>
<p>Almost all research on CBD oil and pain comes from adult trials. There are also several studies that have shown that CBD oil is effective when it comes to dealing with chronic pain, especially those associated with cancers, spinal cord injuries, migraines, arthritis, muscle pain, MS pain and so forth. It is just one of many different molecules called cannabinoids that are found in the cannabis plant.

<p>Interestingly, research has shown that CBD acts to reduce the psychoactive effects of THC, separating hemp further from marijuana. To make sure you are getting genuine CBD oil, check the CBD concentration on the container of the product you're purchasing.

<p>Today the cost for high-quality CBD products starts from 50-75₤ for 300 mg. Hemp derived CBD products with a THC content lower than 0.3% are legal on the federal level but not legal under some state laws. With that said, if you purchase CBD oil at a medical marijuana dispensary or a cannabis retail store, it's possible that it would contain higher amounts of THC, potentially causing a high. Products for sale by Ned contain less than 0.3% THC. The tests can be made by the shade laboratories, which don't have the necessary possibilities to analyze CBD products properly.</p>

<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. This Colorado-based company grows their own organic hemp and they offer a CBD oil with just two ingredients. But recent studies have revealed that the benefits of CBD are best realised when it's combined with THC, leaving people who could potentially benefit from treatment at a loss. This allows cannabidiol and other cannabinoids to interact with your body's systems. We have not ordered or tried any of the hemp oils for sale on Amazon, so we're not saying that they don't work or that they're not any good. Nibbles represent another category of oral CBD products: mints, gum, oral strips, etc.</p>
<p>Crystalline isolate oils, on the other hand, contain no THC and will not compromise drug tests in any way. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky introduced the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, a piece of legislation that proposed legalizing all hemp products at the federal level.

In theory, CBD oil should consist of two main ingredients: the compound cannabidiol dissolved in an oil made from hemp seeds or coconut.</p>

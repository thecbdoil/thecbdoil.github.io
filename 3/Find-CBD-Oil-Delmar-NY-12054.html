<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Narrator: They even have CBD oil products for your pets. Although CBD has alleged benefits like for pain relief, there's no conclusive study about this yet.

So, if your dog is suffering from anxiety, CBD from hemp oil would be a great way to keep him relaxed when he's uncomfortable.

<p>We've found that the best way to evaluate CBD oils is to work out the cost per mg of CBD in the product. Many studies - both animal and human - have examined the link between CBD and pain relief, which are thought to be down to the oil's ability to reduce inflammation and interact with neurotransmitters. While many people report a range of other benefits—and there is some evidence to back them up—experts want multiple trials and multiple peer-reviewed studies to verify any claim before they start making any conclusive statements that could give patients false hope.</p>

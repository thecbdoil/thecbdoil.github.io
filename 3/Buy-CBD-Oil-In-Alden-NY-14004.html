<h2>What Is CBD Oil in Alden?</h2>
<p>The cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa) includes two variations of the same species—hemp and marijuana.

<p>This process results in reduced anxiety, pain, and inflammation. Hemp and marijuana are two different strains of cannabis. Every CBD product is lab tested for quality and potency, and there is a QR code on each product to see third-party test results and confirm that the CBD product you select meets regulatory requirements.

<p>It found CBD oil helped the child safely reduce her anxiety and improve sleep. The cannabinoid that does make you high is THC, which is found in the leaves of a cannabis plant. The more dramatic a health claim is, the more skeptical you should be. Products that claim to cure things like cancer or heart disease should definitely be approached with skepticism, as there currently isn't enough medical research or testing to back those claims. Hemp oil extract, which contains less than 0.3 percent of the compound THC, is legal in all 50 states.</p>

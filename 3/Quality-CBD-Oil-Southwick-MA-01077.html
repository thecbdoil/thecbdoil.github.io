CBD and THC are two types of cannabinoids found in cannabis.</p>
<p>CBD hemp oil has a huge range of potential health benefits and uses, including reducing pain, soothing anxiety, fighting chronic diseases, improving mood, eliminating depression , preventing inflammatory arthritis, protecting the immune system, balancing the metabolism , aiding sleep disorders, and healing the skin , among others.

<p>Research shows that cannabis helps relieve pain and other HIV-related symptoms without causing severe side effects And when marijuana is tested against specific HIV symptoms like liver fibrosis, cannabinoids do not appear to worsen it Although current evidence suggests that CBD could be more helpful than harmful for immune-compromised individuals, the jury is still out. Numerous cancer patients use and buy CBD oil to help with pain and nausea, but the compound may have other, more far-reaching benefits as well.</p>
<p>CBD's common benefits are treating anxiety, reducing pain and inflammation, helping prevent seizures, among many others.

<p>Still, reputable e-commerce companies always include information about the source of CBD; they're happy to provide customers with lab results that let them prove the quality of their products. The severity of seizures, particularly in children and young adults, may be reduced by using CBD oil. Concentrated pure hemp oil can also be infused into skin and body care products and used topically. Studies showed rats on CBD had decreased activity in brain regions associated with pain. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, owns psychoactive properties that get you high.” In its turn, CBD provides only therapeutic benefits.</p>
<p>Other CBD products were actually shown to have enough THC (the intoxicating compound of the cannabis plant) to cause users to fail a drug test What's worse is, just last year, there were even reports of fake CBD products showing up in parts of the United States that were making people sick. It should be noted that no matter what the perceived benefits of CBD oil are, you should never stop taking prescribed medication without talking to your doctor first. That means hemp-derived CBD is legal in the United States unless outlawed at the state level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many test-tube and animal subject studies have show that CBD can indeed help not only prevent death of cardiovascular cells but also reduce inflammation which is often associated with heart disease.

<p>For a product to legally be considered hemp oil, there must be less than 0.3% THC in the CBD products. Since CBD oil includes the full spectrum of cannabinoids, it can produce what experts call an entourage effect ,” where multiple compounds work together to create more intense and possibly more beneficial effects than each compound could have individually. CBD products are not well regulated, so there can be inconsistencies in how much CBD is in a product. CBD, though, does not contain the chemical in marijuana that makes people high.</p>

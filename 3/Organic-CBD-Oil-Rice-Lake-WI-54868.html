Category disclaimer: As a natural product, THC and CBD content in cannabis may vary among lots of the same strain.

<p>As legal and regulatory barriers are being removed and consumer education is spreading across the world, Technavio's market analysts estimate that the global CBD oil market will grow by USD 3.52 billion during 2020-2024 with an estimated CAGR of more than 32% over the next 5 years. Every additional stage of processing the CBD hemp extract exposes the cannabinoids and terpenes to damage. Although several studies have exhibited CBD oil's benefits on patients suffering from epilepsy, anxiety issues, heart problems, Schizophrenia, inflammation, chronic pain, and addiction, research is still on and scientists aren't entirely certain CBD oil's exact level of efficiency in treating these ailments.</p>

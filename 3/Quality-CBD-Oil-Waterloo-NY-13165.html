<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits. Additionally, several animal studies have demonstrated that CBD may help reduce the inflammation and cell death associated with heart disease due to its powerful antioxidant and stress-reducing properties. For a CBD product to be considered as a legal hemp product, it needs to have no more than 0.3% THC.</p>

On the other hand, industrial hemp (or just hemp plant) is a North American Cannabis strain that is actually an agricultural crop that is grown primarily for hemp seed oil and fiber. First of all, CBD is extracted from the flowers, the stems, and the stalks of the cannabis plant (either marijuana or hemp).</p>

Studies have shown cannabis (mostly THC and far less CBD) is effective for reducing pain, including musculoskeletal pain from exercise, as well as stiff joints. Cannabis can also be bred to have low THC levels and high CBD levels, but it's possible that the THC will get concentrated and included in your final products. Now, many people conflate THC and CBD. Broad spectrum CBD oil also contains these concentrations of beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes but has all trace amounts of THC extracted.</p>

While Balance CBD tops our lists, we still recommend that you try or buy CBD oil from the other companies on our best CBD oil list because it's all a matter of personal preference.

<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN). In a 2016 study , Scott Shannon and his fellow researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins demonstrated that CBD oil can be safely and effectively used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders in children with PTSD.</p>
<p>The only FDA approved medical CBD use is for treating epilepsy The strawberry-flavored, sesame oil-based oral solution Epidiolex has been shown to significantly reduce frequency of seizures in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 516 patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. In 2013, a study has shown that users of CBD oil had higher good cholesterol in their bodies compared to those that did not take CBD oil. The brand also offers CBD oils in a wide range of concentrations and strengths.</p>
<h2>All You Need to Know Regarding CBD Oil in Long Island City</h2>
<p>However, as an individual interested in CBD use, here's what you need to know: CBD products derived from hemp, and containing less than 0.3% THC, are legal in most states. CBD oils also contain other nutritious material from the hemp plant, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, terpenes, vitamins, minerals, chlorophyll, amino acids and other trace cannabinoids. Secondly, hemp can produce some THC in addition to CBD, so you might be surprised by THC-positive test results even if you didn't use it. Our products have been made using the purest, highest quality ingredients and backed by the wisdom and principles of time-honored herbal remedies.</p>

<p>Pure Relief CBD oil is something that you need to try when you want to have a simple oil created just for people who need the most powerful oil possible. CBD may temporarily ease symptoms that are caused by digestive problems, muscle pains, and other common medical issues. All our products contain high amounts of CBD (Cannabidiol), which is a cannabis compound that is known for its beneficial effects. For instance, a 2015 study published in the journal Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior found that, in the right dose, caffeine can actually potentially help prevent CBD effects on memory.</p>
<p>On top of the added medical benefits of THC, CBD oil derived from marijuana, not hemp, has been shown to be of better quality and likely have a slower rate of increased tolerance. Relevant research has shown that CBD oil side effects do exist, even though they are rare. CBD-based products can be taken orally, applied to the skin or inhaled. Additionally, animal studies have been conducted to find that CBD may be a potential treatment for arthritis , and one report concluded that "there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults." Dr. Tishler, however, credited THC as the pain-reliever in this case, not CBD.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering that the FDA have not yet approved any nonprescription products, which means people cannot be sure about what their product contains. Although I'm no physician, and am not qualified to recommend any drugs for any specific medical purposes, and you should consult your doctor when considering the consumption of anything that may be medicinal: If you're looking to experiment with CBD products, you might consider looking for CBD products that are whole plant” extract based from very high CBD cultivars.</p>

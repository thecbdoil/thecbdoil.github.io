<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Another huge benefit that comes with using CBD as a pain reliever is that it has no meaningful interactions with opioids, meaning it won't impact the effects of regular painkillers and can be taken alongside them. As with other wellness products, there is no one-size-fits-all serving amount for CBD. CBD is one of 104 chemical compounds, known as cannabinoids, that can be found in the cannabis plant.

<p>Transdermal application, or rubbing a hemp body butter directly onto your skin is an alternative to oral consumption capable of targeting specific pain points.

CBD oil is not a product on which you should skimp on quality.</p>
<p>CBD isolates are exactly what they sound like â€” CBD that has been removed from all other cannabinoids and chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant. Ultimately, the quality of any CBD oil comes down to the extraction process that's used and how well the CBD extract is purified. There are currently no over-the-counter (OTC) CBD products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some products may not be as effective or reliable as others. All products are imported and have undergone strict quality controls to ensure purity and potency at all times.</p>
<p>Our full spectrum CBD oil is CO 2-extracted hemp oil which retains native hemp terpenes (fragrance oils), CBD, minor cannabinoids and less than 0.3% THC. That's why it's important to look for products that are third-party tested, meaning a lab has verified that they contain what the packaging says they do. You should be able to find this information on a company's website.

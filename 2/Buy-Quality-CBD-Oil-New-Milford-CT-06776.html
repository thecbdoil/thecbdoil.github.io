Professor Gino Martini, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Chief Scientist and Professor of Pharmaceutical Innovation at King's College London, says it is important to remember that correctly formulated high-street CBD is of a very low strength; so low that it is classed a food supplement rather than a medicine, meaning it is unlikely that the pharmaceutical industry will ever do clinical trials on it. ‘To be medically effective, the cannabidiol shown in clinical trials - for example, to help children with rare forms of epilepsy - is given at much higher concentrations than what's available for the public to buy,' he says.">

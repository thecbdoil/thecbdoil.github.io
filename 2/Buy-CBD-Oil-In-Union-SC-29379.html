More research is needed to determine the exact role that terpenes play in the overall effects of CBD oil, but it seems clear that terpenes work in concert with cannabinoids to produce a richer effect than CBD alone. First, testing by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has found evidence of ‘potential adverse health effects' from CBD (more on that later) and the FSA has concerns over CBD products being sold that contain unlisted and possibly even hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of psychoactive THC.</p>

Full-spectrum CBD oils will include the full spectrum of cannabinoids available in cannabis plants. Namely, the Farm Bill form 2018 legalized the production of hemp as long as it has a THC concentration below 0.3%. Since CBD oil is most often extracted from hemp itself, it doesn't even have that high of a THC composition anyway.</p>

<p>For mild discomfort and health problems, there's the 125mg CBD oil which offers about 2.08mg of CBD per serving. However, in the hemp plant, which is a different strain of the species Cannabis sativa, CBD is the main active ingredient, and THC is barely present, making its use and legality more widespread. These seeds are high in protein, healthy fats, and other minerals but low in THC or the psychoactive compound you can find in marijuana. If a vendor is marketing something as hemp oil, make sure that you dientify whether it's hemp seed oil or in fact CBD hemp oil made from aerial parts of the plant.</p>

<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. CBD oil offers many potential benefits and can be taken in a variety of ways. Although clinical trials on humans ascertaining the effectiveness of CBD oil for depression are rare, animal model studies, such as these ones from 2014 , 2018 , and 2019 , indicate that it could have similar success as the use of CBD for anxiety has. To be sure that you're getting a product that is legal across all 50 states, you need to double-check that your CBD extracts are made using hemp and contain less than 0.3% THC.

CBDPure oils are made with non-GMO hemp, grown in Colorado by local farmers. However, our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical conditions. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your healthcare provider or 911 immediately.

<p>Most people who use CBD are completely unaware of the possibility of THC exposure With the legalization of hemp—which is simply cannabis with less than 0.3% THC—and hemp-derived products containing CBD, there's potential for those products to have a significant impact on drug testing programs.

<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>

<p>A broad-spectrum product will contain all of those cannabinoids except the THC - which has been removed. However, it's important to note that operating a vehicle or heavy machinery after taking CBD oil — especially higher doses — can increase one's risk of being involved in an accident. CBD oil can technically be CBD hemp oil, but hemp oil is not necessarily CBD oil — and is most often hempseed oil,” she explains.

<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. However, hemp farmers rarely modify the plant. CBD oil is a liquid extract that can be used orally or however you enjoy taking it. Many CBD users choose oil because it is a quick way to experience the effects of CBD anytime and anywhere.

<p>Brands can only sell their products as a food supplement, and must not make medical claims. However, many consumers may be unaware of the actual cannabinoid content of their CBD oil. The updated 2018 Farm Bill will remove hemp from the DEA's list of controlled substances which will also increase the exposure of potential medical CBD benefits.

<p>If a CBD oil has more than 0.3% THC, then it's no longer considered as hemp. When cannabidiol oil is drawn from the Cannabis Sativa plant and bottled for consumption, some brands extract the CBD seed oil and combine it within another type of carrier oil for consumption.

A 2017 study found CBD was effective for chronic neuropathy pain. At EvoPure we are working tirelessly towards this goal and as such have been motivated to create some of the purest, most natural and most research-backed CBD products in the world, in the hope of spreading the news to as many people as possible. The quality of the starting hemp is also a major factor in the cost of the oil. While there are some legitimate operations out there creating the best possible hemp-derived CBD oils, gummies and vapes, others are fly-by-night snake oil salesmen, cutting corners in the quest for the almighty dollar.</p>

Many CBD products display the percentage of CBD contained in the product, which will be between around 2% and 11% of the total (the rest being made up of hemp oil and other ingredients such as olive oil). Alongside this, CBD - in combination with THC - has received regulatory approvals in several European countries and is under study in registered trials with the FDA.</p>

<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. They claim that they make no distinction between CBD derived from marijuana and CBD derived from hemp, and since the state has set up no regulations under the 2018 Agricultural Act regarding hemp, even CBD derived from hemp is illegal unless it's purchased from a licensed medical cannabis dispensary. Scientists have identified over 113 different cannabinoids in cannabis sativa, and each interacts with the endocannabinoid system in a slightly different way, offering potential therapeutic benefits. CBD hemp oil comes in seemingly endless forms, each with a different concentration of CBD and other phytocannabinoids.</p>
<p>This oil has full spectrum hemp extract which means that it doesn't just have CBD. Furthermore, cannabidiol can reduce side effects related to cancer treatment, including nausea, vomiting, and pain. The authors of a study in the journal Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research note that food-grain strains of hemp must contain less than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). People considering CBD oil for anxiety should speak with a doctor to help determine the right treatment for them. Registered patients can possess up to 2.5 ounces of ‘useable marijuana', or up to 12 cannabis plants in an enclosed, locked facility.</p>

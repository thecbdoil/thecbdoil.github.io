<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. CBD is non-intoxicating, it comes with a plethora of potential therapeutic benefits, and above all, it has no side effects of traditional painkillers. Seniors are increasingly looking towards CBD for treating aches and pains, but it can be challenging to find safe products while the market isn't regulated. So our hemp oil products won't get you high. Each batch is tested in a third-party lab, and results can be found directly on the website, which is critical in ensuring the quality of your products. We use a broad-spectrum extract for all of our CBD oils.</p>
<p>Raw CBD oil can be green or dark in color because it often contains phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and raw plant material. However, it's a grab bag of quality because the company can't divulge all of the necessary information in its listing. In our FAQ you can learn all about the CBD oil benefits. This quality makes CBD an appealing option for those who are looking for relief from pain and other symptoms without the mind-altering effects of marijuana or other pharmaceutical drugs. When you are purchasing CBD products, go through a company that has its own store.</p>

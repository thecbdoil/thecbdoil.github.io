When you use a phytocannabinoid, you supplement the bodies natural endocannabinoids to increase the ability (the gain) of the endocannabinoid system to orchestrate (think orchestra conductor) the various receptors and systems needed to bring the body back into a healthy working balance. They might be taken for a ride by people who are marketing unregulated forms of CBD and not get the treatment they need,” Blessing said. Possible health benefits include reducing inflammation and pain. CBD products are touted as safe, natural, and affordable.</p>

While many people report a range of other benefits—and there is some evidence to back them up—experts want multiple trials and multiple peer-reviewed studies to verify any claim before they start making any conclusive statements that could give patients false hope.</p>

<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. The resulting product has a higher concentration of CBD than the raw extract, hence the term CBD-rich oil. They source their organic hemp from Colorado and they submit their products to third-party labs to test their purity and safety. Furthermore, while THC binds with CB1 receptors of your body to produce a sense of euphoria, CBD interferes with the binding of THC, reducing its psychoactive effects. For recovery from difficult workouts, the anti-inflammatory effects of CBD oil may be helpful in healing the damage.</p>
<p>Similar to most things in life, finding an effective hemp CBD oil is ultimately a matter of finding what works best for you personally.

<p>These products work well for people who can't consume any THC due to their jobs.

CBD research is ongoing, and while larger clinical trials are necessary to confirm, plenty of studies show promise in using CBD oil to treat a variety of health issues. It comes from the cannabis plant; however, unlike its counterpart, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the 'high' from marijuana, CBD, derived from the hemp plant, is non-intoxicating and some believe it may have potential health and wellness benefits.</p>

<p>It's important to know that although THC and CBD are the most studied components of cannabis, there are many more chemical compounds found within the plant, such as the phytocannabinoids cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), as well as terpenes and flavonoids.

<p>Check out this ISSA blog post to learn more about the benefits of plant-based proteins, including hemp seeds and products. Because studies are pointing to cannabinoids as a promising treatment for inflammation , CBD may, in fact, be a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's. Much of the research on cannabis products has looked at the use of marijuana rather than at CBD oil as a standalone product. Broad spectrum CBD oil contains a variety of active compounds such as cannabinoids and terpenes, which we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 2.

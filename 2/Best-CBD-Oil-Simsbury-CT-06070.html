However, taking more CBD than needed might cause some unwanted effects such as making you too relaxed for particular activities like work or sports. A prescription for medical cannabis would only be given when it was believed to be in your best interests, and when other treatments had not worked or were not suitable. The biggest side effects, however, come from unwanted elements that might have entered the extract during processing or from carrier oils. There are changes underway on federal and state levels that will ultimately clarify the laws and regulations related to CBD-based products and sales.</p>

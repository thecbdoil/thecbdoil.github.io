This being the case, there are a lot of companies taking advantage of the CBD oil demand thus are making products that don't contain enough or any CBD at all. Meanwhile, hemp seed oil (sometimes called just hemp oil) is made from only the seeds of the hemp plant and contains minuscule (if any) quantities of CBD.</p>

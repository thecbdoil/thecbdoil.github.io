<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket. Each of these uses our high quality hemp extract, with 0% THC. Some manufacturers are advertising CBD products with unproven medical claims, and the quality and safety of these products can vary.</p>
<p>The THC-CBD extract was used in conjunction with opioids This study revealed that using the extract provided more effective pain relief than using the opioids alone. Although a lot more research needs to be done in this area of study, initial studies have laid the foundation for the use of CBD oil to lower the risk of diabetics. The cannabinoids in CBD massage oil helps to reduce inflammation and soothes muscles. Unlike THC, CBD does not have intoxicating effects on the body.

<p>The typical source for CBD isolate is hemp whereas full- and broad-spectrum extracts can come from other cannabis plants as well. CBD oil multipacks are available with hemp and olive oil carriers and come in concentrations from 5-20% CBD. CBD oil brand Celtic Wind (available at Lloyds Pharmacy) cold presses the whole plant, retaining all the original compounds. Hemp-derived CBD oil is non-intoxicating.

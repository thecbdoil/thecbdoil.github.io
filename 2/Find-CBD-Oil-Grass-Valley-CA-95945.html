<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. They offer high-potency products like Super Good Vibes, which has over 33 mg of CBD in each dropper-full. People refer to cannabis plants as either hemp or marijuana, depending on how much THC they contain. Using CBD and THC mixture showed a positive effect in reducing short-term withdrawal and craving and cannabis use disorders. Currently, CBD is legal in the UK, but another component of cannabis, THC, is still illegal. Although CBD and THC are both found in Cannabis sativa, each has a very different effect on the human body.</p>

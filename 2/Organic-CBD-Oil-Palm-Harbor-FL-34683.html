<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Marijuana products, on the other hand, are only legal in about 11 states at the moment over the counter, and over a dozen other states through medical-only programs. This trend is encouraging several CBD oil companies to focus on the internet-savvy customer segment and explore the new online retailing format based on websites and portals. The CBD in hemp oil has been used by patients with recalcitrant epilepsy for decades. Their CBD oil is sourced from hemp that is grown and processed in the U.S. and verified by stringent testing to create extremely effective full-spectrum supplements.</p>

But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>

The CBD component of cannabis oil offers similar benefits as its relative THC but doesn't tend to create the sense of euphoria (aka, high) that THC tends to.</p>

With the legalization of marijuana products, more research is possible, and more answers will come. Many things make CBD Armour's Silver CBD oil the best CBD products out there.

<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. Yet another study, published in Current Pharmaceutical Design, another peer-reviewed medical journal that covers issues related to pharmacology and medicinal chemistry, found that CBD has effects similar to those of certain antipsychotic drugs and that this compound is much safer and a more effective option for people with schizophrenia. Research conducted exploring what is CBD and CBD benefits also conclude that cannabidiol produces an therapeutic effects by activating PPARs, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.</p>
<p>Although raw and refined pure hemp extract is available, the vast majority of CBD oil products contain additional ingredients such as vegetable oils or other essential oils. This step makes the medicinal oils in the plant more bioavailable. Properly produced CBD oil from hemp does not contain THC in high enough concentrations to cause a high. Consumers can expect to be confused by terms like CBD,” hemp,” and marijuana.” All these terms have multiple meanings and can be used in popular but incorrect ways, which only adds to the confusion.</p>

<p>This means that a doctor must apply to the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) for an approval to be able to prescribe products containing CBD. The CBD in most products is extracted from hemp, a variety of cannabis that has only traces (up to 0.3%) of THC, the active compound that gets people high. Many CBD products display the percentage of CBD contained in the product, which will be between around 2% and 11% of the total (the rest being made up of hemp oil and other ingredients such as olive oil). Alongside this, CBD - in combination with THC - has received regulatory approvals in several European countries and is under study in registered trials with the FDA.</p>

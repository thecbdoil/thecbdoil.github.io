<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. While the scientific jury may still be out on some of the benefits of CBD oil, people are still using it and finding relief. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Most CBD oil and treats for dogs comes from hemp oil , so it contains no or very small traces of THC. Although ingesting CBD offers the most benefits, the body can absorb CBD through the skin.

<p>However, the CBD drug Epidiolex was approved by the FDA in June 2018 to treat intractable epilepsy in pediatric patients - the very first CBD-based drug (and only the second cannabis-based drug behind Sativex) to receive federal approval. Beyond those states, there are 15 states that restrict access to CBD products derived from industrial hemp with less than 0.3 THC.

<p>CBD and THC act as external stimulants that have similar effects on this very powerful body system, causing different kinds of reactions on different parts of the body. THC is the psychoactive part of cannabis and marijuana that gives that "high" associated with those products. However, further research is needed to determine CBD's other benefits and safety. No. Unlike marijuana or other cannabis products, THC doesn't have the psychoactive cannabinoid associated with the high” feeling most people are familiar with.</p>
<p>THC is also present in other species of cannabis plants but in different amounts. It helps to do your research and compare products based on potency, flavors, price, size, extraction, broad vs. full-spectrum, how you consume the CBD, dietary restrictions, and other factors.

<p>These products may or may not include CBD. There have been many studies on rats that show the success of CBD oil in reducing pain. The tricky part is that there's some evidence suggesting CBD works best for pain when combined with a little THC, says Dr. Danesh. Their product is ethically sourced from small farms in the U.S. The oil has just two (high-quality) ingredients: organic coconut MCT oil and organic, full-spectrum, phytocannabinoid-rich (PCR) hemp extract.

<p>CBD can be extracted from the same plant as marijuana, or from hemp â€” another cannabis plant that is now legal in the United States.

<h2>How much CBD should I take in Okemos, Michigan?</h2>
<p>The plant Cannabis sativa has two primary species, hemp and marijuana. Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, impacts the brain without a high, and tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC, has pain-relieving properties. The plant is cold processed in high quality extra virgin hemp seed oil. Overall, CBD oil is extracted from the flowers of the hemp plant, instead of the leaves or seeds. One study found that a single dose of cannabidiol helped to reduce blood pressure in healthy patients. On the other hand, CBD oil is made with extracts from the flowers, leaves, and stalks of cannabis Sativa, which are rich in CBD and other cannabinoids.</p>
<p>In such a landscape, athletes are rightly curious about and eager for cannabidiols' (CBD) promises of pain relief and reduced inflammation without the risks associated with NSAIDs or opioids. Terpenoids are the natural oils produced by hemp and they're responsible for the plant's distinct aroma. Solvents that are commonly used to extract CBD from cannabis include supercritical CO2, ethanol, hydrocarbons (such as butane) and olive oil.

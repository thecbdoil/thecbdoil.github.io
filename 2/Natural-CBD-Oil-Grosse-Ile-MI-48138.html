While none of this pollen should make it into your CBD oil, and very few people are allergic to marijuana pollen, you should still be careful the very first time using CBD oil and use as tiny an amount as possible. As research into cannabis- and hemp-derived CBD expands, doctors and healthcare providers will have a better understanding of how CBD works and who might benefit most from it.</p>

Well, that is if you are consuming a low-quality cannabidiol oil or you're relying on a brand that's not telling you the whole story. Because of its somewhat tumultuous history marijuana has had with the law (regarding whether it is illegal or not), research on the positive properties of hemp plants' derivatives such as cannabidiol oil has been extremely limited. Studies have named cannabidiol as an effective treatment for IBS because of its ability to control the neuroimmune system, a network of structures connecting the gut microbes, immune system, and central nervous system.</p>

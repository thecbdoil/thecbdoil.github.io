<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. They claim that they make no distinction between CBD derived from marijuana and CBD derived from hemp, and since the state has set up no regulations under the 2018 Agricultural Act regarding hemp, even CBD derived from hemp is illegal unless it's purchased from a licensed medical cannabis dispensary. Scientists have identified over 113 different cannabinoids in cannabis sativa, and each interacts with the endocannabinoid system in a slightly different way, offering potential therapeutic benefits. CBD hemp oil comes in seemingly endless forms, each with a different concentration of CBD and other phytocannabinoids.</p>
<p>But, as mentioned, many brands out there make false claims about their CBD products. An important consideration here is that street cannabis often contains a much higher THC content (and thus less CBD): this skunk” is what the majority of UK cannabis users are using. It can be taken orally, but CBD oil for topical use is often recommended for muscle and joint pain. These tests screen for any bacteria, pesticides, and other harmful substances that can contaminate the CBD oils. For most people, price is a huge factor in decision making when purchasing products.</p>

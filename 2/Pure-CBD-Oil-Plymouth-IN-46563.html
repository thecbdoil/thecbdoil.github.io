<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. When the Control Substance Act was passed in 1970, cultivation of both hemp and marijuana was banned, making it even hard to research or use CBD extract. Luckily, if the level of CBD is high enough, the psychoactive side effects of THC are counteracted. However, scientists believe CBD encourages the body to produce more endocannabinoids. The hemp the brand uses was specifically bred to have high CBD and really low THC. All of our CBD products are guaranteed to contain 0% THC, and each and every product that leaves the facility is third-party tested to ensure consistency and quality.</p>
<p>This oil has full spectrum hemp extract which means that it doesn't just have CBD. Furthermore, cannabidiol can reduce side effects related to cancer treatment, including nausea, vomiting, and pain. The authors of a study in the journal Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research note that food-grain strains of hemp must contain less than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). People considering CBD oil for anxiety should speak with a doctor to help determine the right treatment for them. Registered patients can possess up to 2.5 ounces of ‘useable marijuana', or up to 12 cannabis plants in an enclosed, locked facility.</p>

In most areas tests are still ongoing, but it is believed that CBD can help with heart problems, epilepsy, anxiety, sleep problems, chronic pain, depression, acne , arthritis and cancer-related issues.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol can only be included in "cosmetic" products and only if it contains less than 0.3% THC. That's why all of our products are made using locally-grown hemp, extracted using eco-friendly solvent free CO2, and free from harmful chemical byproducts. CO2 extraction doesn't require additional solvents, which helps to keep the CBD oils clean and pure. Our Virgin cannabis sativa hemp oil is a hemp seed oil, and our Premium hemp oil products, have hemp oil from the stem of the plant (which is listed in milligrams on the bottle) It also has hemp seed oil in the bottle to act as a carrier oil.</p>

<p>While both oils come from cannabis plants and both oils are non-intoxicating, hemp seed oil contains very little CBD, so you won't really receive the benefits associated with the entourage effect. The benefits of CBD oil have yet to be proven by concrete scientific research, but the existing studies show promise. The chemical that is responsible for weed's psychoactive effects is called THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol , and it is mostly removed from CBD products. And we're continuing to hear more about cannabis-sourced products.</p>

In a recent study, patients who were undergoing chemotherapy used CBD oil and found it helped to reduce the side effects of chemo, particularly feelings of nausea.</p>
<p>Apart from that, reputable companies also have to make sure that their hemp plants are organically grown. And only a small amount of THC—as low as the 0.3 percent cutoff required for CBD products made from hemp—may be needed to enhance CBD's therapeutic effect. CBD, which stands for Cannabidiol, is one of the many chemicals made by the plant Cannabis Sativa L. A 2019 study showed that CBD applied to the skin as an ointment significantly reduced inflammatory skin disease and scarring. A CBD oil routine is beneficial for anyone interested in maintaining health and promoting wellness.</p>
<p>Several other test-tube and animal model studies have proved that CBD oil has great potential to reduce inflammation and thus help prevent cognitive degeneration often linked to Alzheimer's disease. CBD oil is not meant to be used as a replacement for any medications or healthy habits. The TSA officially allows hemp-derived CBD products to be taken on airplanes, but there have still been reports of confiscations and other hassles at airport checkpoints.

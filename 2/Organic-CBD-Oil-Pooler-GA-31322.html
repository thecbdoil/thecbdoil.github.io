<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits. Additionally, several animal studies have demonstrated that CBD may help reduce the inflammation and cell death associated with heart disease due to its powerful antioxidant and stress-reducing properties. For a CBD product to be considered as a legal hemp product, it needs to have no more than 0.3% THC.</p>

<p>Always check to make sure you know the CBD content of the products you purchase. CBD is not inexpensive like products such as vitamins and minerals. It is because hemp only recently became legal to grow in the U.S. that many of the finished hemp goods that you see for sale in America, from food products to clothing to building materials, are part of an imported hemp industry that has surpassed $688 million annually.

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>
<p>A growing list of research initiatives seems to suggest that CBD oil can be an effective and safe treatment for inflammation and pain related to lupus. THC is arguably the most famous member of the cannabinoids family — it's the one found in marijuana that causes a high. Hemp does contain the compound CBD (cannabidiol.)

PlusCBD Oil is made with the following: alpha-tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate, Saponaria, quillaja, monolaurin, silica, monk fruit, peppermint oil, olive oil, hemp oil, and water.</p>
<p>Today, we're clearing up the murkiness surrounding cannabis products, their differences, and the legality of taking them so we can focus on all the benefits of hemp oil extract as well as the ins and outs of buying and consuming it. With this dilemma, business owners usually opt for hemp-derived CBD oils. There are no shortage of subpar companies out there producing low-grade CBD oil products that are a far cry from the contents that are listed on the label. Well, just like pain medications, traditional treatments for anxiety has a wide range of side effects to the human body.</p>
<p>Szaflarski JP, Bebin EM, Cutter G, DeWolfe J, et al. Cannabidiol improves frequency and severity of seizures and reduces adverse events in an open-label add-on prospective study. There are many benefits of CBD oil and there are so many different ways to use it. If you see CO2 extraction on the label of CBD oil, it means that there is a pure product.

<p>CBD comes from an entirely different plant - the hemp plant - that contains trace amounts of THC but not enough to cause a high. Experts do not recommend CBD oil for use in children, as there is little research on the effects of CBD oil on a child's developing brain. It's assumed that the use of CBD oil for PTSD has a neurobiological basis in similar processes as the ones that enable it to regulate anxiety. However, CBD is an ingredient sourced from certain hemp plants that are bred to provide health benefits, not to provide a so-called 'high'.</p>
<p>Some studies have used a combination of CBD and other cannabinoids, so it's difficult to isolate the effects of cannabidiol. They use full-spectrum CBD oil carried in MCT oil, which is the industry standard for quality. Prior to 2015, the CBD oil market was relatively small, with the total market sales thought to be valued at around $202 million Of this, approximately $90 million came from hemp-derived CBD oil products, while the rest (around $112 million) came from the sale of marijuana-derived CBD oil. Many people love how the products make them feel, but you should be careful if you are trying to self-treat a serious condition.</p>

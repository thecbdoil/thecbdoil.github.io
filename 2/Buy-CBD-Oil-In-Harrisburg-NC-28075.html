While CBD oil is made from the leaves or buds of a cannabis plant, hempseed oil is made by pressing oil from hempseed,” says Kyle, who likened it to how olive oil is made by pressing whole olives.

CBD oil derived from hemp will not produce a high.” Hemp is a type of cannabis plant grown for industrial use, such as making paper and clothing. For example, if the product contains 500 mg of CBD, the same concentration of cannabinoids should be mentioned in the report.

There are currently no over-the-counter (OTC) CBD products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some products may not be as effective or reliable as others. All products are imported and have undergone strict quality controls to ensure purity and potency at all times.</p>

As women juggling parenthood and demanding careers, we yearned for a CBD Hemp Oil that actually worked and was sourced from the highest quality hemp and extraction process.

<h3>How To Buy CBD Oil in Leesville SC</h3>

When purchasing CBD oil, ensure that the product is lab tested, 100% natural, soy free, and non-GMO. One other way to generate high-quality CBD oil is using a method known as CO2 extraction.

<p>I can honestly - and sadly - say the only difference I noticed was to my bank balance.' Professor Gino Martini, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Chief Scientist and Professor of Pharmaceutical Innovation at King's College London, says it is important to remember that correctly formulated high-street CBD is of a very low strength; so low that it is classed a food supplement rather than a medicine, meaning it is unlikely that the pharmaceutical industry will ever do clinical trials on it. ‘To be medically effective, the cannabidiol shown in clinical trials - for example, to help children with rare forms of epilepsy - is given at much higher concentrations than what's available for the public to buy,' he says.</p>
<p>CBD oil concentrate is all-natural hemp oil extracted from the stalk of non-GMO hemp plants, tested for quality, and packaged for sale in an easy-to-use oral applicator with no additives.

However, many companies only offer CBD oil in low to moderate potencies. While previously hemp was only legal to grow for hemp pilot programs and research needs, the passage of the 2018 bill reclassified hemp as an agricultural commodity and made it legal to produce all hemp-derived products, including CBD oil.</p>

<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. The resulting product has a higher concentration of CBD than the raw extract, hence the term CBD-rich oil. They source their organic hemp from Colorado and they submit their products to third-party labs to test their purity and safety. Furthermore, while THC binds with CB1 receptors of your body to produce a sense of euphoria, CBD interferes with the binding of THC, reducing its psychoactive effects. For recovery from difficult workouts, the anti-inflammatory effects of CBD oil may be helpful in healing the damage.</p>
<p>Hemp plants houses hundreds of cannabinoids. There are two rules to follow when comparing CBD products. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a chemical compound naturally found in the genus of plants known as cannabis. CBD oil has been safely used to treat anxiety, including sleeplessness and PTSD. Unlike most meds meant for PD management, however, CBD oil doesn't come with serious side effects like ankle swelling, insomnia, liver damage, urinary problems, constipation, diarrhea, skin blotching, and nausea. CBD oil is a perishable product, so we recommend storing the bottle in a dry, cool, and dark location for best results.</p>

<p>Once consumed, THC attaches itself to the body's cannabinoid receptors and activates them immediately, which is why you can get high from consuming THC products. Hemp Bombs is another company that oversees the whole process of their CBD products, from seed to sale. There are still no regulations for how often CBD products must be tested.

Because it has a high cannabidiol (CBD) content, most CBD products are derived from this plant.</p>
<p>Let's start by explaining what CBD oil is. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a cannabinoid, a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants.

<p>It's thought that CBD interacts with receptors in the brain and immune system to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. However, with the way a lot of brands market their products, consumers end up thinking that they're the same.

<p>These products may or may not include CBD. There have been many studies on rats that show the success of CBD oil in reducing pain. The tricky part is that there's some evidence suggesting CBD works best for pain when combined with a little THC, says Dr. Danesh. Their product is ethically sourced from small farms in the U.S. The oil has just two (high-quality) ingredients: organic coconut MCT oil and organic, full-spectrum, phytocannabinoid-rich (PCR) hemp extract. The company is currently focused on the health benefits that hemp delivers and is actively marketing hemp-based consumer products and solutions.</p>

Every additional stage of processing the CBD hemp extract exposes the cannabinoids and terpenes to damage.

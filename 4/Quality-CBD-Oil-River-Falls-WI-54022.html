<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. The THC levels in Healthspan CBD products are within Home Office guidelines, and the product is legal to possess and consume. While there isn't conclusive data to support CBD or CBD oil as the preferred method of pain management, researchers agree that these types of products have a lot of potential.

Like different strains of marijuana, there are countless varieties and different strains of hemp out there; and not all of them produce useful amounts of CBD.

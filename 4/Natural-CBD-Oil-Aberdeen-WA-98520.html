Even though research is in the fairly early stages when it comes to using CBD oil for anxiety , there is already a surprising amount of evidence pointing to a beneficial outcome. Some research suggests that in some people, CBD may work better when it's combined with at least a little THC, says Martin Lee, director of Project CBD, an advocacy group that supports CBD research and the author of "Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana—Medical, Recreational, and Scientific" (Scribner, 2012).</p>

<p>This attention to detail extends to our carefully curated selection of cannabis oil products. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of over a hundred cannabinoids that exist within the Cannabis sativa species and utilised in CBD oil form. Research on cannabidiol oil (CBD oil) is still in its infancy, but there is mounting evidence to suggest that some people can get relief from anxiety In this article, we examine what CBD oil is and how it may help reduce anxiety symptoms.

<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket. Each of these uses our high quality hemp extract, with 0% THC. Some manufacturers are advertising CBD products with unproven medical claims, and the quality and safety of these products can vary.</p>
<p>Although there is not much hereditary difference between cannabis and hemp, the plants' flowers and leaves contain different amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid responsible for getting high.” Though research has shown some traces of THC in certain CBD oils, most do not contain any THC. But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>

To help consumers differentiate between high quality CBD Oil and inferior products, Veré starts with transparency. When preparing to take a liquid form, be aware that the CBD extract is mixed with a carrier oil, so there are two measures to know: the amount of the liquid product to take (the dose) and the amount of CBD in each dose. CBD oil affects the body by interacting with built-in receptors that are already present within us.</p>
<p>More recent research conducted in 2016 discovered that mice predisposed to diabetes developed type 1 diabetes much later than expected, showed marginally reduced signs oxidation (inflammation) and had significantly increased the production of insulin in the pancreas when they were treated with CBD oil. Most CBD oils are sold in concentrations of 300 to 750 mg, although this may range from less than 100 mg to more than 2,000. Cannabis Doctors Australia (CDA) urges the public to be cautious about buying hemp products, over the shelf or online, that claim to contain CBD.</p>

<p>The plant Cannabis sativa has two primary species, hemp and marijuana. Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, impacts the brain without a high, and tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC, has pain-relieving properties.

One study found that a single dose of cannabidiol helped to reduce blood pressure in healthy patients. On the other hand, CBD oil is made with extracts from the flowers, leaves, and stalks of cannabis Sativa, which are rich in CBD and other cannabinoids.</p>

<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Despite the above listed potential side effects, a review of clinical data found that the side effects of CBD used for certain applications were less severe than side effects from common medications used to treat those same health conditions. CBD can come from the marijuana plant but it is most commonly harvested from the hemp plant to eliminate the THC. Keep up with new strains, products, trends, and deals with Leafly's curated cannabis newsletter. As another precaution for people who experience drowsiness as a result of consuming CBD oil, reducing the dosage can be a good option.</p>
<p>Although there is not much hereditary difference between cannabis and hemp, the plants' flowers and leaves contain different amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid responsible for getting high.” Though research has shown some traces of THC in certain CBD oils, most do not contain any THC. But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>
<h2>Hemp Oil: A Super Food in Hopkins?</h2>
<p>However, in this case, low priced CBD oil will probably mean a low concentration of CBD, and you'll most likely be throwing your money away. Be sure to also source high-quality CBD products. These products can be bought online and easily shipped to most U.S. states. For instance, a study published in Neurotherapeutics in 2015 noticed that CBD has significant potential as a treatment option for muscle spasticity, tension, rigidity and other conditions that result from poor workouts, overwork or chronic stress.</p>
<p>CBD oil can be made from two substances, either from the marijuana plant or from the hemp plant. And the best way to buy CBD oil online is by having a wealth of information at your fingertips. As women juggling parenthood and demanding careers, we yearned for a CBD Hemp Oil that actually worked and was sourced from the highest quality hemp and extraction process. So, before we explain the benefits of CBD oil in detail, let's first understand what CBD really is. A 2011 study also found that cannabidiol could reduce social anxiety.</p>

If consuming CBD is your ultimate goal, then read the labels of all the products you purchase. These brands offer a range of products and forms of CBD.</p>

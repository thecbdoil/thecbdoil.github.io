<p>Because CBD oil comes from a plant, it is all-natural, making CBD a go-to in the world of natural remedies. Many of these products are advertised as hemp oil supplements.” However, upon further investigation, you'll notice none of them mention anything about CBD. Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine. While there's a lot of tongue-wagging around cannabis-related products, there is a burgeoning awareness about the potential medical benefits of CBD oil.</p>

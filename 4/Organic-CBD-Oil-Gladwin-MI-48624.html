<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. Our ultimate goal is to create CBD wellness products that we would not only take ourselves but also be proud to share with our friends and family. But there are still products labeled as dietary supplements on the market that contain cannabidiol. CV Sciences products are sold in more than 1,500 health food stores nationally, including Campbell's Nutrition in Des Moines and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in West Des Moines. CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a natural active compound found in Cannabis plants. Incidentally, no cases of toxicity or overdose from the use of hemp-based (industrial-grade hemp) CBD oil have been reported so far.</p>

Another study published in 2014 looked to establish if cannabidiol could help treat obstructive sleep apnea, which affects close to 100 million people worldwide.

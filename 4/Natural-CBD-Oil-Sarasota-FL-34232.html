CBD oil has been studied for its potential role in easing symptoms of many common health issues, including anxiety, depression, acne and heart disease. Using pesticides and GMOs are inaccessible technologies for CBD products. CBD oil isn't the same as hempseed oil, which is sometimes labeled as hemp oil. CBD oil made from hemp is non-intoxicating and will not cause any euphoric effects, but how using CBD oil makes you feel can vary from person to person.</p>
<p>As a resident of the state, you can buy quality CBD oil in Pennsylvania in one of two ways: either obtain a medical marijuana card and buy from a legal state-licensed dispensary, or order from a reputable online seller and have the products shipped directly to your PA home (see our updated 2020 picks below for some of the highest quality CBD oils in the US).

Our CBD products are produced by our sister company HempFlax, ensuring quality control and product tracking from beginning to end of the manufacturing process.

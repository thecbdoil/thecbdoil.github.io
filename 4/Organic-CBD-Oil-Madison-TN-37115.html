<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket. Each of these uses our high quality hemp extract, with 0% THC. Some manufacturers are advertising CBD products with unproven medical claims, and the quality and safety of these products can vary.</p>
<p>Finally, the generalized stress relief effects of CBD also mean that it can reduce the cardiovascular system's response to it, while at the same protecting white blood cells and their migration, as well as regulating blood platelet aggregation.

As one World Health Organisation report recently put it: In humans, CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential… To date, there is no evidence of public health-related problems associated with the use of pure CBD.” So, with limited comedowns and the potential for high-grade health benefits, maybe it's time you gave CBD the green light.</p>

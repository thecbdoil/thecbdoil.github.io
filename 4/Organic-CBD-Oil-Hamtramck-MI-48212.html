<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. Scientists have identified over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids. There are literally hundreds of CBD companies selling CBD online that will ship directly to your door — many of which don't even charge for shipping.</p>
<p>Although raw and refined pure hemp extract is available, the vast majority of CBD oil products contain additional ingredients such as vegetable oils or other essential oils. This step makes the medicinal oils in the plant more bioavailable. Properly produced CBD oil from hemp does not contain THC in high enough concentrations to cause a high. Consumers can expect to be confused by terms like CBD,” hemp,” and marijuana.” All these terms have multiple meanings and can be used in popular but incorrect ways, which only adds to the confusion.</p>

CBD oils use cannabidiol as base or carrier oil while the tinctures have an alcohol base.</p>
<p>This means that a doctor must apply to the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) for an approval to be able to prescribe products containing CBD. The CBD in most products is extracted from hemp, a variety of cannabis that has only traces (up to 0.3%) of THC, the active compound that gets people high. Many CBD products display the percentage of CBD contained in the product, which will be between around 2% and 11% of the total (the rest being made up of hemp oil and other ingredients such as olive oil). Alongside this, CBD - in combination with THC - has received regulatory approvals in several European countries and is under study in registered trials with the FDA.</p>

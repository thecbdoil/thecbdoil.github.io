<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil comes from the bud and flowers of the cannabis plant. A 2017 study found CBD was effective for chronic neuropathy pain. At EvoPure we are working tirelessly towards this goal and as such have been motivated to create some of the purest, most natural and most research-backed CBD products in the world, in the hope of spreading the news to as many people as possible. The quality of the starting hemp is also a major factor in the cost of the oil. While there are some legitimate operations out there creating the best possible hemp-derived CBD oils, gummies and vapes, others are fly-by-night snake oil salesmen, cutting corners in the quest for the almighty dollar.</p>
<p>Derived from the stalk and seed of cannabis (hemp) plants, hemp oil is a natural botanical concentrate that is high in the compound CBD. Medical studies have suggested that CBD has a multitude of benefits for various health conditions. In an earlier study, researchers found that CBD treatment can prevent 56 percent of diabetic mice from developing diabetes. Anecdotally, CBD oil benefits are plentiful.

Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine.

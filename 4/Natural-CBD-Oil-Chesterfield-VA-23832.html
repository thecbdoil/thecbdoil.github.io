<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits. Additionally, several animal studies have demonstrated that CBD may help reduce the inflammation and cell death associated with heart disease due to its powerful antioxidant and stress-reducing properties. For a CBD product to be considered as a legal hemp product, it needs to have no more than 0.3% THC.</p>

<p>Thus, based on the research above, taking CBD oil in pill form may mean that your body only receives as little as 6 percent of the CBD. So far, so confusing, but part of the problem is that terms like cannabis and hemp are often used interchangeably - which masks the nuances and complexities of the cannabis plant. Pregnancy: Research on the use of CBD oil during pregnancy is unfortunately lacking, but most experts do not recommend it. Other anecdotal reports support its use, particularly for aching muscles and anxiety or depression.</p>

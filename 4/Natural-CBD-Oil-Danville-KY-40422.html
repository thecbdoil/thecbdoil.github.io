<p>Not to be confused with hemp seed oil , CBD oil comes from industrial hemp plants that have been bred to contain trace amounts of THC - the ingredient in the marijuana plant that's associated with a so-called ‘high'. Because CBD works with specific neurotransmitters to reduce anxiety and increase the ability to focus, initial studies have shown promise in its ability to increase the quality of life by decreasing the symptoms of ADHD for many sufferers. Conversely, the hemp plant will have a higher concentration of CBD than THC.</p>
<p>Other studies show that CBD lessened the physical signs of anxiety, which include sweaty palms, dizziness, racing heart, and chest pain.

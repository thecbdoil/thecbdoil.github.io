<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. More research is needed to determine the exact role that terpenes play in the overall effects of CBD oil, but it seems clear that terpenes work in concert with cannabinoids to produce a richer effect than CBD alone. First, testing by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has found evidence of ‘potential adverse health effects' from CBD (more on that later) and the FSA has concerns over CBD products being sold that contain unlisted and possibly even hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of psychoactive THC.</p>
<p>By augmenting the body's own cannabinoids, CBD and the other trace cannabinoids found in hemp oil are able to stimulate the endocannabinoid system to encourage balance and optimal functioning. However, when used in moderate amounts, most people do not experience these side effects, and none of them are known for being fatal or particularly dangerous. Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>

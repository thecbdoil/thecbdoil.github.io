Back in 2011, a study published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology found that when people with generalised social anxiety disorder (SAD) were given 600mg of CBD oil prior to a public speaking test, as opposed to a placebo, they experienced significantly less anxiety, difficulty and discomfort during their speech.</p>
<p>Other studies show that CBD lessened the physical signs of anxiety, which include sweaty palms, dizziness, racing heart, and chest pain. Both of these substances are indeed part of the plant, they interact with cannabinoid receptors which can be found in your body and in your brain, but their effects are widely different. Simply Pure offers affordable broad-spectrum CBD oils tested for purity and potency with a third-party lab so that you know you are buying something safe and effective. Since CBD oil is derived from hemp, you may wonder if CBD oil and hemp oil are the same things.</p>
<p>Opting for quality over quantity, the only product they sell is their full-spectrum CBD tincture. Veré partners with the best labs in the industry that use chromatography to identify and eliminate trace THC in our Broad Spectrum CBD Oil Tincture and our Pure CBD Oil, while preserving the profile of the non-psychoactive cannabinoids. This is important mainly if you want to avoid the head-high that comes with THC, something that is important to many people who are considering CBD. Many CBD products sold online and in retail stores come from hemp, not marijuana.</p>
<p>Animal studies have shown that treatment with CBD significantly lowered the amount of damage to brain tissue following states of low blood flow characteristic of stroke (cerebral infarction) ( R ). It's believed this action is made possible by interaction with serotonin receptors.

It is still necessary to conduct numerous researches to explore the properties of cannabidiol, its impact on the body, and efficiency in treatment.</p>

<p>The best CBD oils on the market are those that will help you manage your health, change the way that you address your health problems, and will make you feel like a functional human being during the day. However, taking more CBD than needed might cause some unwanted effects such as making you too relaxed for particular activities like work or sports. A prescription for medical cannabis would only be given when it was believed to be in your best interests, and when other treatments had not worked or were not suitable. The biggest side effects, however, come from unwanted elements that might have entered the extract during processing or from carrier oils. There are changes underway on federal and state levels that will ultimately clarify the laws and regulations related to CBD-based products and sales.</p>
<p>The murkiness of federal CBD law, and the patchwork of state rules, make selling products with the compound perilous, said Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, an industry group. While recreational cannabis use remains illegal in the U.K., CBD products with low THC content (below 0.2%) have been deemed safe for legal consumption (as it is non-psychoactive).

If you've spent any time researching CBD products, you'll know there's a confusing number of brands and products to choose from. With so little CBD in the bottle, it's no wonder these products lack the benefits that were advertised. We'll get to that later, but first, here are the best CBD oils that made it to our list.</p>
<p>Much of this research is still in the early phases (with a lot of room to learn more), however, CBD may be worth adding to a daily routine for those frustrated with traditional treatment options. In the meantime, much research is underway, and many studies about CBD's effects on the human body have already been published. The hope is for CBD oil and other cannabis-derived products to help with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or arthritis Many athletes use topical CBD products , either oil or cream, for joint pain.</p>

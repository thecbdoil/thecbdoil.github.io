However, it's important to note that operating a vehicle or heavy machinery after taking CBD oil — especially higher doses — can increase one's risk of being involved in an accident. CBD oil can technically be CBD hemp oil, but hemp oil is not necessarily CBD oil — and is most often hempseed oil,” she explains.

<p>However, take into consideration that, as with any other remedy or medicine, preexisting conditions can exacerbate, or simply nullify CBD benefits. There is some thought that those rare few who do experience increased anxiety when taking CBD may be having an allergic reaction to something in the CBD, so it's best if you have a history of having histamine reactions or allergies to take a form of CBD that has the fewest added ingredients and a carrier oil that is not going to trigger your allergies. However, Before you begin to supplement your efforts with CBD oil, consult your physician.</p>

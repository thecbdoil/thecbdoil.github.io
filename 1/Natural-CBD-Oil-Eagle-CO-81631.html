<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>
<p>Hemp-derived CBD is legal federally. Even though recreational pot is far from legal on a national scale, the use of medical marijuana is currently permitted in 30 of America's 50 states This might be why the majority of our respondents had already heard whispers about marijuana's non-psychoactive derivative, CBD-a substance oft-used as an alternative treatment for common ailments including pain, depression, and anxiety. Also, depending on the amount used and route of administration, these products have the potential to produce impairing drug effects.</p>

If you'd like to use CBD oil to help ease your arthritis pain, you may be wondering how much to administer or apply. On Twitter, H3 Infusion boasted that its hemp extract is our first 2% water soluble CBD” and included a link to its Amazon product page.</p>

<p>A recently published review of studies of these effects conducted between 1975 and 2018 can attest to the enormous potential of the use of CBD creams and CBD oil for pain. Medical professionals and scientists are only now beginning to develop dosing schedules for medical marijuana, medicinal hemp, and their extracts (including CBD). When a health condition is related to an imbalance in the ECS then we need to stimulate the system with the addition of phytocannabinoids (plant-based cannabinoids) to help the system regain homeostasis and rebalance the health of the system.</p>
<p>Due to controversies surrounding the cannabis plant, industrial-grade CBD is extracted from hemp (another plant that falls under the Cannabis Sativa species), as it has less than 0.3% THC. Chronic pain is one of the primary reasons why people are drawn to hemp oil. Zuardi, A. W., Shirakawa, I., Finkelfarb, E., and Karniol, I. G.

<p>While nutritious, hemp seed products contain extremely low levels of CBD per weight, making them inadequate for those seeking CBD's balancing effects. CBD's benefits are numerous, making it a popular product to promote wellness. Instead, CBD oil helps promote relaxation, healthy sleep, and pain relief. This isolate has been refined to contain no hemp plant materials outside of the CBD compounds themselves, including no measurable THC. We love reading positive stories about the impact our products have on people's everyday lives.</p>

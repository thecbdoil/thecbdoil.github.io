<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. Their CBD products were created with the Hawaiian Islands as their inspiration, and they deliver a special kind of mellow. Another cause for concern is the unreliability of the purity and dosage of CBD in products. Improving Heart Health—research has found that CBD oil not only reduced blood pressure but somewhat regulated it. Avoid companies that claim their products have disease benefits. Hemp, on the other hand, only has a tiny amount of naturally-occurring THC and can be sold when the hemp oil has less than 0.3% THC.</p>
<p>Raw CBD oil can be green or dark in color because it often contains phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and raw plant material. However, it's a grab bag of quality because the company can't divulge all of the necessary information in its listing. In our FAQ you can learn all about the CBD oil benefits. This quality makes CBD an appealing option for those who are looking for relief from pain and other symptoms without the mind-altering effects of marijuana or other pharmaceutical drugs. When you are purchasing CBD products, go through a company that has its own store.</p>

<p>Thus, based on the research above, taking CBD oil in pill form may mean that your body only receives as little as 6 percent of the CBD. So far, so confusing, but part of the problem is that terms like cannabis and hemp are often used interchangeably - which masks the nuances and complexities of the cannabis plant. Pregnancy: Research on the use of CBD oil during pregnancy is unfortunately lacking, but most experts do not recommend it. Other anecdotal reports support its use, particularly for aching muscles and anxiety or depression.</p>

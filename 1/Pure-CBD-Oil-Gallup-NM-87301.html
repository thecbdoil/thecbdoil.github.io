<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN). In a 2016 study , Scott Shannon and his fellow researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins demonstrated that CBD oil can be safely and effectively used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders in children with PTSD.</p>
<p>Derived from the stalk and seed of cannabis (hemp) plants, hemp oil is a natural botanical concentrate that is high in the compound CBD. Medical studies have suggested that CBD has a multitude of benefits for various health conditions. In an earlier study, researchers found that CBD treatment can prevent 56 percent of diabetic mice from developing diabetes. Anecdotally, CBD oil benefits are plentiful. The product that you shared has whole plant extract instead of just CBD mixed with a flavouring agent and carrier oil.</p>
<h2>What Is CBD Oil in Gallup?</h2>

In a study of patients with arthritis, CBD effectively reduced pain, stiffness and inflammation In another study of those with multiple sclerosis, patients experienced improvement in pain reduction, walking and muscle spasms when taking CBD.</p>

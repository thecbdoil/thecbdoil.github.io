<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. While CBD oil is made from the leaves or buds of a cannabis plant, hempseed oil is made by pressing oil from hempseed,” says Kyle, who likened it to how olive oil is made by pressing whole olives. Both hemp and marijuana have dozens of other beneficial phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol. Because the FDA doesn't regulate CBD, it is possible to buy a product that is more or less potent than advertised, or even contains small amounts of THC. Hemp seeds make an effective way to grow hemp crops that will eventually produce CBD, but you have to really know how to plant the seeds.</p>

Although a lot more research needs to be done in this area of study, initial studies have laid the foundation for the use of CBD oil to lower the risk of diabetics. The cannabinoids in CBD massage oil helps to reduce inflammation and soothes muscles. Unlike THC, CBD does not have intoxicating effects on the body. Their CBD oil has a strong hemp flavor, with nothing to cover up the natural earthy taste of cannabis.</p>

<p>However, before visiting the clinic you must register online so we are able to discuss your condition and if Medical Cannabis is right for you. The first difference you'll notice in hemp oil vs. CBD oil is the part of the cannabis sativa plant that these oils come from.

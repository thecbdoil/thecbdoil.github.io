<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. CBD doesn't contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana that produces a high. CBD also works as an anti-inflammatory which can reduce pain associated with swollen areas. Two species of cannabis are the marijuana plant and the hemp plant.

On the other hand, industrial hemp (or just hemp plant) is a North American Cannabis strain that is actually an agricultural crop that is grown primarily for hemp seed oil and fiber.

<p>The plant Cannabis sativa has two primary species, hemp and marijuana.

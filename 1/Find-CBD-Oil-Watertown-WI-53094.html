<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. In a short-term study , 42 patients taking CBD oil reported reduced cravings for up to one week after their dose of CBD.

Our quality department has processes in place to verify the concentration and quality of our CBD products. CBD almost seems too good to be true but the science behind its benefits is overwhelming, and the body of literature supporting it literally grows every day.

An older study in the journal Nutrition & Metabolism highlights the nutrient profile of hemp seeds and notes that they might have a positive effect on various health issues, such as high blood pressure , atherosclerosis , and cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>CBD's common benefits are treating anxiety, reducing pain and inflammation, helping prevent seizures, among many others.

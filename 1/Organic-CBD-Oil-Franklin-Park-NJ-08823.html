<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. Hemp oil extract in the United States refers to the oil extracted from the stalk of the hemp plant. In the United States, CBD oil is legal in some states, but not all. Remember, the best CBD products contain less than 0.3% THC and come from 100% organic, non-GMO, and pesticide-free industrial hemp. They are best suited for the production of industrial hemp, seeds, and CBD. Bottom line: CBD oil has been found through several studies to help reduce depression and anxiety disorders in both animals and humans.

In recent studies shown in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, there is an undeniable connection between the reduction of pain and inflammation and CBD. Although there are several products available in the market that can reduce the aging effects, most of them are not effective like CBD oil products.

The review was based on several animal and human studies on the use of CBD for treatment or management of psychotic disorders, cognitive conditions, and epilepsy. Yes, CBD derived from hemp plants is legal in the U.S. Growing, processing and selling hemp and hemp-derived products for commercial purposes in the United States is permitted.

<p>At Royal CBD, we use industrial hemp to source our cannabidiol. However, cannabis is currently the most terpene-dense plant known to humans. CBD oil comes from these legal hemp plants. Vaping allows you to feel the benefits of CBD the fastest, but scientists warn that we still don't know what the long term effects of vapes are. When you're browsing for CBD oil, check to see if the product has a third-party lab report and certificate of analysis (COA) that verifies the product contains no THC. To make hemp oil products for consumer use, the flowers (or buds) are harvested from the fibrous industrial hemp plants and the plant's oil is extracted from the flowers.</p>
<p>It's important to know that although THC and CBD are the most studied components of cannabis, there are many more chemical compounds found within the plant, such as the phytocannabinoids cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), as well as terpenes and flavonoids. CBD oil is an isolated extraction of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol. THC is the psychoactive component of cannabis that causes a euphoric high, but CBD oils contain very low concentrations of THC.</p>

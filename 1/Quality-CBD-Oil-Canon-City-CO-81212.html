<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. Coffee shops sell CBD lattes, spas offer CBD facials, beauty companies are rushing to release lotions with CBD or hemp oils in their formulas. Much of the CBD used medicinally around the world comes from the hemp plant, and not from psychoactive marijuana. A 2016 study published in The Permanente Journal examined the effectiveness of CBD oil for Pediatric anxiety and insomnia as part of post-traumatic stress disorder. Cannabidiol (more commonly known as CBD) has experienced a surge in popularity in recent months, in part due to its availability in high-street health shops.</p>

One study found that a single dose of cannabidiol helped to reduce blood pressure in healthy patients.

<p>Always check to make sure you know the CBD content of the products you purchase. CBD is not inexpensive like products such as vitamins and minerals.

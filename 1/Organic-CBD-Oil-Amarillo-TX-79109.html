One study singled out CBD itself as potentially dangerous for the development of a healthy fetus. If cannabis is only legal for medicinal use in your state, then you'll need a recommendation from your doctor before you can purchase CBD oil. Researchers have actually recognized over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN.</p>

Usually, CBD products for pets are available in the form of edibles so that they are consumed via the digestive system. So far, many states in America and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana with high THC concentration. One way in which CBD products may dampen pain is by inhibiting the release of inflammatory agents like glutamate. CBD oil has no or negligible traces of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol - another compound found in the plant), which is indeed a psychoactive cannabinoid and is responsible for the famous marijuana high.</p>

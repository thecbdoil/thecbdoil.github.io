<p>A nation-wide study recently found that 4.7 million Brits now say they regularly take CBD oil over vitamin D supplementation. Full spectrum products, in addition to their CBD content, contain a wide range of supportive phytochemicals, including beneficial compounds like terpenes, flavonoids, omega acids, and phytocannabinoids. Our registered industrial hemp-derived Pure CBD Oil tests at a minimum of 99%+ CBD purity and is third-party lab tested and verified 100% THC-free.

<p>A 2013 study found that CBD treatment can indeed reduce one's dependence on nicotine or tobacco smoking. The research into the health benefits of CBD oil are ongoing but early indications suggest that CBD may be a practical, more natural, solution to a wide range of medical conditions. Touted for a variety of health benefits, CBD is flooding the marketplace in the form of topicals, edibles, tinctures, and vape oils.

The evidence we have so far suggests CBD does reduce inflammation. CBD is derived from the leaves and flowers of mature hemp plants using sophisticated extraction methods, purification, and distillation.</p>

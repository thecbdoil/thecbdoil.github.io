<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. CBD (cannabidiol) is a compound found in cannabis and hemp.

This is why many CBD oil companies can ship to all 50 U.S. states - because their products are hemp-derived.</p>

Many studies - both animal and human - have examined the link between CBD and pain relief, which are thought to be down to the oil's ability to reduce inflammation and interact with neurotransmitters. While many people report a range of other benefits—and there is some evidence to back them up—experts want multiple trials and multiple peer-reviewed studies to verify any claim before they start making any conclusive statements that could give patients false hope.</p>

<p>As with other cannabinoids, CBD oil may interfere with saliva production and cause dry mouth or cottonmouth”. The effects of CBD on the individual depends on dosage, absorption, quality, and whether the oil is an isolate or a full-spectrum product. I'm already using CBD oil for anxiety, and now I know the correct dosage for me. A great resource.

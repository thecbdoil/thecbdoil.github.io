<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. While CBD oil is made from the leaves or buds of a cannabis plant, hempseed oil is made by pressing oil from hempseed,” says Kyle, who likened it to how olive oil is made by pressing whole olives. Both hemp and marijuana have dozens of other beneficial phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol. Because the FDA doesn't regulate CBD, it is possible to buy a product that is more or less potent than advertised, or even contains small amounts of THC. Hemp seeds make an effective way to grow hemp crops that will eventually produce CBD, but you have to really know how to plant the seeds.</p>
<p>This raw extract can be put through a series of filtration and distillation processes to remove unwanted compounds, such as waxes and chlorophyll, and produce various classes of oils differing in purity and CBD content. Fab CBD offers a limited range of products, but what it lacks in variety it definitely makes up in quality. In one study on morphine-addicted rats, CBD oil allowed them to reduce their dependence on the drug. CBD oil isn't likely to cause the same set of negative effects. Another study carried out a couple of years later confirmed that CBD has the potential of relieving inflammation and pain linked to arthritis when applied topically.</p>

<p>Cannabidiol and THC are just two of the plant's more than 100 cannabinoids. This is a real concern in the industry—take the 2017 Journal of the American Medical Association study, for example, which tested 84 CBD products and found that 26% contained lower doses than stated on the bottle. Several studies have shown that CBD oil has a high potential for treating skin conditions, like eczema, by encouraging abnormal cell death. A 2016 study conducted on a rat model of arthritis reported that CBD gel was effective in reducing the pain and swelling in the rats' joints.</p>
<p>Brands can only sell their products as a food supplement, and must not make medical claims. However, many consumers may be unaware of the actual cannabinoid content of their CBD oil. The updated 2018 Farm Bill will remove hemp from the DEA's list of controlled substances which will also increase the exposure of potential medical CBD benefits. CBD oil consists of a high-CBD cannabis extract in a carrier oil base, such as coconut-derived MCT oil. Some people in warmer and more humid climates tend to store their CBD oil in their refrigerator.</p>

<p>Interestingly, research has shown that CBD acts to reduce the psychoactive effects of THC, separating hemp further from marijuana. To make sure you are getting genuine CBD oil, check the CBD concentration on the container of the product you're purchasing. Scientists first coined the term ‘the entourage effect' in 1998, with research suggesting that cannabinoids work alongside CBD to increase its effect in the body's endocannabinoid system. As the largest CBD manufacturer to partner with 1% for the Planet, we'll be donating 1% of Sunsoil's annual sales to help environmental non-profits that do good for people, plants and our planet.</p>

The Wellers bites even carried the Amazon's Choice” badge, a label the company uses to recommend products. For example, some people may experience anxiety as a side-effect of CBD, while others find that CBD helps their anxiety. Meanwhile, a 2017 study led by Bonn-Miller found that nearly 7 of 10 CBD products didn't contain the amount of marijuana extract promised on the label.</p>
<p>Hemp is grown and cultivated primarily for industrial purposes such as for textiles and health foods, while Cannabis is grown for recreational and medicinal purposes. The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research. Many cannabis-based products are available to buy online, but their quality and content is not known. CBD also inhibits the re-uptake of neurotransmitters adenosine and anandamide , both known to elevate mood and limit the effects of anxiety.</p>
<p>CBD is generally well tolerated, but people with compromised immune systems or those taking prescription medications could be at risk of side effects. CBD and THC are found in the highest amounts relative to the other cannabinoids found in the plant. For example, one review of existing literature examined multiple trials and studies and found that CBD can treat chronic pain.

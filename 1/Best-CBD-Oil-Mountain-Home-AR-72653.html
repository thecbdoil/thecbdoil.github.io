<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. CBD Hemp Oil - Often referred to as full-spectrum CBD oil” or full-spectrum hemp extract,” these oils are produced by extracting phytochemicals and phytocannabinoids from industrial hemp - a variety of cannabis that contains less than 0.3% THC by weight. However, cannabinol (CBN) did trigger a positive test, and of course, products with some THC triggered a positive test as well. If you were to type in the following phrases, you will get a list of products that actually might carry some cannabinoids in them.</p>
<p>Kevin Boehnke, PhD, a researcher at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center at the University of Michigan, focuses on medical cannabis as an analgesic and opioid substitute in chronic pain. We've included a list of some of our favorite CBD oils above. A full-spectrum CBD oil, on the other hand, refers to CBD extracted from the hemp plant. So, if your dog is suffering from anxiety, CBD from hemp oil would be a great way to keep him relaxed when he's uncomfortable. Also, our gummies are our only products that use a CBD with zero THC (our other products are made from full-spectrum hemp extract).</p>
<h2>Cannabis Oil a Cancer Treatment Alternative to Chemotherapy in Mountain Home?</h2>
<p>CBD comes from hemp and cannabis plants. Research and customer anecdotes demonstrate how CBD may benefit a plethora of conditions including anxiety, inflammation, arthritis, joint pain, migraines, pain, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), inflammation and sleep. CBD Oil is a prepared Cannabidiol extract from the Cannabis sativa plant—marijuana for us laypeople—that has demonstrated some remarkable health benefits. Some early research shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily does not improve anxiety during public speaking in people with social anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>Because CBD oil comes from a plant, it is all-natural, making CBD a go-to in the world of natural remedies. Many of these products are advertised as hemp oil supplements.” However, upon further investigation, you'll notice none of them mention anything about CBD. Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine. While there's a lot of tongue-wagging around cannabis-related products, there is a burgeoning awareness about the potential medical benefits of CBD oil.</p>
